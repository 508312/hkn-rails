  %h1 Course Surveys
  %p
    Course survey data for all undergraduate and graduate level EECS courses are available here.

    There are hundreds of thousands of pages, so, although most aspects work fine, there may be errors of which we are unaware.  If you spot an error, especially a missing class or professor, or have a suggestion for the site, please email www-coursesurvey@hkn.
